# Agent Current Context (P1, 2026-03-21)

## Purpose
- This file is the compact execution truth for daily work.
- Keep only active contracts, current boundaries, and route pointers.
- Move detailed implementation notes to targeted P2 docs.

## Scope And Priority
- Primary host: macOS.
- Delivery order: macOS first, Windows regression-free, Linux compile/contract-level.
- macOS stack rule: new capability modules are Swift-first; avoid expanding `.mm` for new large modules.
- Windows VS2026 project sync (2026-03-21) is healthy again at direct project-build level; treat any remaining `MFCMouseEffect.slnx` `ValidateSolutionConfiguration` failure as solution-metadata work, not a C++ compile regression.

## Runtime Lanes
- Stable lane: `scaffold`.
- Progressive lane: `core` (`mfx_entry_posix_host`).
- Policy: new cross-platform capability lands in `core` first, then backports as needed.

## Active Product Goals
- Keep wasm runtime bounded-but-expressive with host-owned render boundaries.
- Keep plugin lanes decoupled (`effects` vs `indicator`) with explicit diagnostics.
- Keep automation mapping accurate and observable with low regression risk.
- Rebuild `mouse_companion` on a plugin-first route with click-first visible parity.

## Capability Snapshot

### Visual Effects / WASM
- `click / trail / scroll / hold / hover` are active in `core`.
- Shared command tail (`blend_mode / sort_key / group_id`) is active.
- Group-retained model is active; transform/material/pass remain host-owned.
- Windows blacklist routing root fix is active:
  - pointer-driven effect suppression now resolves the process at the current screen point first on Windows
  - trail synthetic-follow generation is limited to a short post-input smoothing window
- Cross-platform click ripple baseline is active:
  - Windows no longer ignores `EffectConfig.ripple`
  - default click contract is now shorter, smaller, center-clear, softer-glow, and single-ring
  - double-ring regression was removed again on both Windows and macOS

### Input Indicator
- macOS/Windows label and streak semantics are aligned (`L xN`, `W+ xN`).
- Indicator wasm dispatch has dedicated lanes and a budget floor.
- `/api/wasm/load-manifest` auto-infers surface and avoids cross-surface misload.
- `SetInputIndicatorConfig` syncs runtime host immediately after apply.
- Missing/stale indicator manifest falls back cleanly to native mode.

### Plugin Management / WebUI
- Unified top-level `Plugin Management` section is active.
- WebUI apply flow is backend-state-driven (`post-apply reconcile + refresh`).
- Sidebar order is fixed:
  - `General -> Mouse Companion -> Cursor Effects -> Input Indicator -> Automation Mapping -> Plugin Management`
- Shell top-bar layout regression fix is active:
  - stable three-column layout (`brand / center status / actions`)
  - center status expands from the title boundary
  - short status stays visually one-line aligned with actions
  - long status wraps without deforming the action row

### Mouse Companion
- Backend reset remains in effect; old skeleton runtime stays removed.
- Plugin-first landing route is active (`Phase0 -> Phase1 -> Phase2`).
- Shared `IPetVisualHost` + `PlatformPetVisualHost` abstraction is the stable cross-platform visual-host seam.

#### Windows Pet
- Windows pet is in `Phase1.5`: real transparent layered host window + visible placeholder backend are active.
- Shared placement contract is active on Windows:
  - `relative`
  - `absolute`
  - legacy `fixed_bottom_left`
  - `strict / soft / free`
  - target-monitor resolution
- Current Windows placeholder is no longer just an embedded renderer; the active backend path is now:
  - `window -> backend factory/registry -> renderer input -> renderer runtime -> scene builder -> painter`
- Current Windows placeholder already consumes:
  - shared action semantics
  - `PetPoseFrame`
  - appearance/action-library asset lanes
  - lightweight readiness diagnostics
- Windows pet backend selection diagnostics are now active too:
  - `preferred_renderer_backend_source`
  - `preferred_renderer_backend`
  - `selected_renderer_backend`
  - `renderer_backend_selection_reason`
  - `renderer_backend_failure_reason`
  - `available_renderer_backends`
  - `unavailable_renderer_backends`
  - `renderer_backend_catalog`
  - `real_renderer_preview`
  - `renderer_runtime_*`
  - test mouse-companion route now also returns `renderer_runtime_before / renderer_runtime_after / renderer_runtime_delta`
  - test mouse-companion route now also supports test-friendly `wait_for_frame_ms` and `expect_frame_advance`, so Windows renderer proof can wait briefly for a new frame and report pass/fail in one response
- Renderer backend lifecycle seam is now explicit too:
  - backend selection no longer stops at constructor success
  - factory now treats `Start() / IsReady() / LastErrorReason()` as first-class fallback signals
  - placeholder backend is the current always-ready reference implementation
- Backend preference parsing is now a separate seam too:
  - factory no longer owns env-string normalization directly
  - current canonicalization accepts `default` as an alias of `auto`
  - preference source resolution now also routes through a dedicated registry; current built-ins are `env` and final `default`
  - explicit preference requests now travel through the same registry path too, instead of bypassing source resolution
  - Windows visual host now forwards an internal runtime-config preference request into window/backend selection before renderer creation
  - if that internal runtime-config backend preference changes after host start, the window now attempts an in-place backend reselection and preserves the current renderer if the replacement selection fails
  - mouse companion config/json now already has hidden persistence lanes for backend preference source/name, but WebUI does not expose them yet
  - hidden backend preference fields now also round-trip through settings state, apply-settings payloads, and runtime/test diagnostics
  - runtime/test diagnostics now also report whether the hidden config preference is the active resolved preference via `configured_renderer_backend_preference_effective` and `configured_renderer_backend_preference_status`
  - renderer registry/factory diagnostics now also distinguish currently unavailable backends from simply unselected ones, so future real-backend rollout can report machine/runtime gating reasons without changing the host contract again
  - a `real` backend now has a complete internal preview pipeline (`asset resources -> scene runtime -> scene builder -> painter -> render`), and the preview output is already a pose/action-aware stylized pet instead of a pure diagnostics card; default selection still keeps it unavailable behind a rollout gate, so current placeholder-first behavior stays unchanged
  - that preview path now also adds action-specific overlays inside `scene -> painter`, and those overlays now vary stroke/alpha emphasis per action intensity too, so `click / hold / scroll / follow / drag` are easier to distinguish visually during Windows bring-up instead of relying only on diagnostics fields
  - the preview face is now action-aware too: brows, mouth arc, and blush strength react to `click / hold / scroll / follow / drag`, so real-preview verification is not limited to silhouettes and motion marks
  - the preview posture is now action-aware too: body lift, head offset, shadow compression, tail lift, and limb cadence all vary per action, so Windows bring-up can distinguish states from whole-body rhythm rather than only overlays
  - the preview body/head/limb silhouette emphasis is now action-aware too: stroke weight and chest emphasis vary with action intensity so state separation is visible even before reading overlay glyphs
  - the preview glow/shadow/palette emphasis is now action-aware too: glow size, shadow/pedestal alpha, and accent presence now vary with action intensity so overall mood changes along with the active state
  - the preview action rhythm is now more state-specific too: click rebound, hold squeeze, scroll bob, drag pull, and follow gait all ride renderer-owned time phases instead of only changing static amplitudes
  - that action rhythm now also propagates through appendages more coherently: ears, tail, hands, and legs share the same renderer-owned gait/squeeze/pull phases instead of moving as mostly independent amplitude offsets
  - idle preview now also has a lightweight time-driven life rhythm via `poseSampleTickMs`: breathing, subtle hand float, ear cadence, shadow breathing, and tail sway keep the Windows preview from freezing into a static card when no action is active
  - real preview motion semantics are now split behind a dedicated `Win32MouseCompanionRealRendererMotionProfile` seam, so future visual tuning does not keep inflating `SceneBuilder`
  - real preview action overlay geometry is now split behind `Win32MouseCompanionRealRendererActionOverlayBuilder`, so overlay variants evolve independently from core body/head/limb layout
  - real preview face geometry is now split behind `Win32MouseCompanionRealRendererFaceBuilder`, so expression tuning stays isolated from both main body layout and overlay-specific assembly
  - real preview accessory/badge assembly is now split behind `Win32MouseCompanionRealRendererAdornmentBuilder`, so lane badges, pose badge, and accessory markers do not keep leaking back into the main scene builder
  - real preview color/material assignment is now split behind `Win32MouseCompanionRealRendererPaletteBuilder`, and renderer-owned color/theme tokens now also travel through `Win32MouseCompanionRealRendererPaletteProfile`, so skin/theme/status tuning no longer requires touching geometry assembly or builder-local literals
  - real preview appendage geometry is now split behind `Win32MouseCompanionRealRendererAppendageBuilder`, so ears, tail, hands, and legs evolve independently from the core body/head frame
  - real preview core frame geometry is now split behind `Win32MouseCompanionRealRendererFrameBuilder`, so body/head/shadow/pedestal layout stays isolated from appendages, palette, face, adornment, and overlays
  - real preview builders now share `Win32MouseCompanionRealRendererLayoutMetrics`, so body/head size conventions no longer travel as scattered bare float parameters across seams
  - real preview builder seams now also share `Win32MouseCompanionRealRendererStyleProfile`, and frame/palette/appendage/face/adornment/overlay builders are actively consuming it for ratio/scale defaults, expression anchors, accessory geometry offsets, and frame/palette tuning values instead of keeping those values duplicated in implementation bodies
  - `renderer_backend_catalog` is now the structured source of truth for backend inventory; `available/unavailable` arrays remain as lightweight compatibility views
  - the `real` backend now also publishes explicit unmet requirements through both `renderer_backend_catalog[*].unmet_requirements` and top-level `real_renderer_unmet_requirements`
  - `real_renderer_unmet_requirements` is now expected to be empty on current code; default unavailability is controlled by rollout gate `MFX_WIN32_MOUSE_COMPANION_REAL_RENDERER_ENABLE`
  - runtime/test diagnostics now also publish a derived `real_renderer_preview` summary so Windows bring-up can verify rollout gate, selected backend, preview-active state, action lane, pose lane, and asset-lane readiness without reading renderer internals
  - the selected Windows renderer backend now also reports a backend-owned runtime snapshot (`renderer_runtime_*`), so diagnostics no longer have to infer preview state only from controller-side cached fields
  - backend-owned runtime diagnostics now also include render-proof fields (`frame_count`, `last_render_tick_ms`, `surface_width`, `surface_height`) so Windows bring-up can confirm that a test event really produced a new rendered frame
  - render-proof helpers are now extracted out of the mouse-companion test route, and Windows test API now also exposes a compact `/api/mouse-companion/test-render-proof` path for frame-advance validation without returning the full runtime payload
  - Windows test API now also exposes `/api/mouse-companion/test-render-proof-sweep`, so bring-up can check a compact status/click/hold/scroll/move/hold-end proof sequence in one response instead of replaying those calls by hand
  - a matching Git Bash helper now exists too: `tools/platform/manual/run-windows-mouse-companion-render-proof.sh`, so Windows bring-up can call single proof or sweep proof without manually rebuilding curl payloads
  - the sweep proof route and Git Bash helper now also produce pass/fail summaries, so Windows bring-up can detect missed frame-advance expectations without manually counting per-event proof rows
  - both the single proof path and the sweep path now support optional `expected_backend` and `expect_preview_active` checks, so Windows bring-up can verify renderer selection, preview activation, and frame advance through the same gated proof contract
- Current boundary:
  - visible backend is stable enough for `Phase1.5` structural work
  - Windows still does not render the real 3D model yet
  - real-renderer work should plug in behind the existing backend/runtime seams instead of reopening host/controller layers

#### macOS Pet
- macOS Phase1 visual host is active:
  - model-first with placeholder fallback
  - `.usdz` preferred when SceneKit can load it
  - runtime action updates are forwarded (`idle / follow / click_react / drag / hold_react / scroll_react`)
- Shared placement contract is active on macOS:
  - `relative`
  - `absolute`
  - legacy aliases kept for compatibility
  - `strict / soft / free`
- Runtime `size_px` resize path is active and no longer create-time-only.
- Click/head-tint parity work is active:
  - click one-shot restarts immediately
  - tint fades continuously on frame ticks
  - click stays on a tauri-style press/rebound envelope
- Idle/follow parity direction is active:
  - `hover -> idle`
  - `follow` is defined as an upright walk, not crawl
  - drag-only yaw remains separate from idle/follow facing
- Scroll direction visual is active:
  - one scroll direction keeps the pet upright
  - the opposite direction flips presentation head-down without changing skeleton solving
- Current known boundary:
  - `.usdz` framing still needs care because projected bounds can under-report height on some paths
- Read on demand:
  - `/Users/sunqin/study/language/cpp/code/MFCMouseEffect/docs/architecture/mouse-companion-plugin-landing-roadmap.zh-CN.md`
  - `/Users/sunqin/study/language/cpp/code/MFCMouseEffect/docs/architecture/mouse-companion-action-clip-contract.zh-CN.md`

### Automation Mapping
- App-scope normalization/parser contracts are stable.
- Preset/custom gesture mapping with thresholding and ambiguity rejection is active.
- Trigger button supports `none`.
- `Draw -> Save` custom gesture flow is active.
- macOS shortcut capture/injection punctuation path is aligned.

## Observability And Debug Contract
- Runtime diagnostics are gated by debug mode where required.
- Default non-debug run avoids high-volume debug lanes.
- WebUI debug polling is adaptive and focus-aware.
- Mouse companion test route remains gated behind `MFX_ENABLE_MOUSE_COMPANION_TEST_API=1`.

## Regression Gates
- Canonical regression entry:
  - `./tools/platform/regression/run-posix-regression-suite.sh --platform auto`
- macOS daily shortcut:
  - `./mfx run-no-build` / `./mfx fast` skip both core and WebUI rebuilds
  - `./mfx run` / `./mfx start` perform fresh build preparation

## Packaging / Startup Truth

### Tray Menus
- macOS tray menu intentionally exposes only:
  - `Star Project`
  - `Settings`
  - `Exit`
- Windows tray menu now follows the same product rule.

### Launch At Startup
- macOS:
  - LaunchAgent now uses `tray` mode, not `background`
  - explicit settings toggle rewrites plist and applies `launchctl`
  - normal app startup repairs plist only and does not bootstrap/bootout service state
- Windows:
  - uses `HKCU\\Software\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Run`
  - current executable path is rewritten idempotently so relocation can self-heal
  - detail doc:
    - `/Users/sunqin/study/language/cpp/code/MFCMouseEffect/docs/architecture/windows-launch-at-startup-contract.md`

### macOS Packaging
- Preferred entrypoint:
  - `./mfx package`
- Aliases:
  - `./mfx package-no-build`
  - `./mfx pack`
  - `./mfx pkg`
- `run/start/package` now share the same macOS core/WebUI preparation helper.
- Packaged output truth:
  - standard `MFCMouseEffect.app`
  - `Install/macos`
  - folder + `.zip` + unsigned `.dmg`
- Current package policy:
  - only minimal pet runtime assets are bundled
  - wasm demo plugin keeps only runtime files
  - packaged host binary is stripped in-bundle
  - package icon is low-weight generated `MFX`
  - DMG layout is install-oriented (`left app / right Applications`)
  - `Install/macos/` is git-ignored
  - Gatekeeper/notarization is still deferred
- Detail doc:
  - `/Users/sunqin/study/language/cpp/code/MFCMouseEffect/docs/ops/macos-portable-packaging.md`

### Windows Packaging
- User-facing packaging entry is also `./mfx package`.
- Windows installer remains Inno Setup based under the hood.
- `mfx.cmd` is the Windows wrapper for the shared `mfx` bash entry.
- Current policy:
  - no bundled `d3dcompiler_47.dll`
  - no installer-side startup task duplication
  - install directory stays runtime-focused

## Contracts That Must Not Drift
- Keep stdin JSON command compatibility.
- Keep current wasm ABI compatibility unless migration is explicitly approved.
- Keep host-owned bounded rendering strategy; no raw shader ownership without architecture approval.
- Keep docs synchronized in the same change set for every behavior or contract change.
