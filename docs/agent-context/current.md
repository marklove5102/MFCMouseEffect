# Agent Current Context (2026-02-25)

## Scope and Priority
- Primary dev host: macOS.
- Primary target: macOS usable loop first.
- Constraints: no Windows regression; Linux follows compile + contract coverage.

## Current Program State
- Branch baseline has completed Phase 50 -> Phase 55zj code slices.
- POSIX dual-lane guardrail exists:
  - scaffold lane remains default stable lane.
  - core lane is gated and iteratively enabled.
  - macOS core lane now includes:
  - global input capture/degraded handling
  - input indicator + click-first visible effect
  - baseline scroll visible effect (`MacosScrollPulseEffect`)
  - automation mapping foundation
  - WASM runtime backend (`wasm3_static`) with renderer strategy path
  - WASM plugin catalog/import/export HTTP APIs in WebSettings
  - WASM plugin folder import dialog path on macOS (native picker)
  - import dialog supports `probe_only=true` for non-interactive regression checks
  - test-gated `/api/wasm/test-dispatch-click` enables non-interactive invoke/render contract checks
  - test-gated `/api/automation/test-app-scope-match` enables non-interactive app-scope alias contract checks (`code/.exe/.app`)
  - test-gated `/api/automation/test-binding-priority` enables non-interactive priority contract checks (`process > all`, `longest chain > shorter chain`)
  - test-gated `/api/automation/test-match-and-inject` enables non-interactive matcher+injector integration checks (`history -> selected binding -> inject`)
  - test-gated `/api/automation/test-shortcut-from-mac-keycode` enables non-interactive `Cmd+V/Cmd+Tab` mapping contract checks
  - shortcut test API now has explicit invalid-keycode contract (`supported=false`, `vk_code=0`, empty `shortcut`, reason code) with regression guard
  - WASM runtime action routes (`load-manifest`/`reload`) now expose structured `error_code`, and contracts now cover `manifest_path required` + `reload ok` semantics
  - `wasm_reload` command path is now truly cross-platform (no Windows-only no-op), with deterministic `reload_target_missing` contract validated via test-gated runtime-reset probe
  - WASM reload missing-module path is now contract-gated via deterministic fixture flow (`load -> remove entry wasm -> reload => module_load_failed/load_module`)
  - WASM reload manifest-api mismatch path is now contract-gated via fixture mutation (`load -> api_version=2 -> reload => manifest_api_unsupported/manifest_api_version`)
  - WASM fixture orchestration is now helperized in one shared script module used by regression and manual selfcheck, reducing fixture-flow drift
  - WebUI WASM action error model now maps runtime load/reload error codes (`reload_target_missing`, `module_load_failed`, `manifest_api_unsupported`, etc.) to stable user-facing messages, and legacy WebUI EN/ZH i18n keys are now kept in parity for those runtime codes
  - WebUI WASM error-model test now asserts i18n parity (`action-error-model` keys must exist in `WebUI/i18n.js` for both `en-US` and `zh-CN`), preventing future mapping-vs-dictionary drift
  - WASM route path contracts now explicitly gate `load-manifest` `manifest_path` trim/blank semantics and folder-dialog probe `initial_path` trim semantics (`"  path  "` succeeds and roundtrips as canonical path; `"   "` keeps required-path failure where expected)
  - test-gated `/api/automation/test-inject-shortcut` enables non-interactive injector call-path checks (`Cmd+C`) under dry-run mode

## macOS Manual Runner
Use this one-command entry for manual WebSettings verification on macOS core lane:
```bash
./tools/platform/manual/run-macos-core-websettings-manual.sh --auto-stop-seconds 60
```

Use this one-command entry for WASM runtime invoke/render/fallback selfcheck:

./tools/platform/manual/run-macos-wasm-runtime-selfcheck.sh --skip-build
```

Use this one-command entry for automation injection selfcheck (`left_click -> Cmd+C` path):

```

## Current Next Slice
- Continue M2 with macOS-first WASM quality and contract hardening.
- Keep platform abstraction reusable for Linux follow-up.
- Keep Windows behavior unchanged unless explicit approved scope.

## Behavior Contracts to Preserve
1. Permission loss on macOS should degrade safely, keep process alive, and notify clearly.
2. Permission restore should recover without requiring process restart.
3. Scaffold lane contracts must remain unchanged.
4. Core lane API contracts must stay backward-compatible.
5. Web settings must remain Svelte-based and shared across platforms.
6. WASM plugin catalog/import/export API semantics should stay aligned across Windows and POSIX core lane.
