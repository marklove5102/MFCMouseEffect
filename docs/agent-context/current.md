# Agent Current Context (2026-02-25)

## Scope and Priority
- Primary dev host: macOS.
- Primary target: macOS usable loop first.
- Constraints: no Windows regression; Linux follows compile + contract coverage.

## Latest Delta (2026-02-28)
- macOS active source ownership is now fully promoted to main paths under `Platform/macos/{Effects,Overlay,Shell,System,Wasm}`; `Platform/macos/legacy` no longer contains active source files.
- Build wiring is updated to compile from `legacy` paths while keeping existing headers/contracts in place (`Platform/macos/CMakeLists.txt`, `Platform/CMakeLists.txt`).
- macOS Swift bridge build now uses explicit latest-stable language mode policy via `MFX_SWIFT_LANGUAGE_MODE` (`auto|5|6`, default `auto`; auto resolves to Swift 6 on Swift 6 toolchains, else Swift 5).
- macOS native folder picker is now Swift-owned end-to-end (`OpenPanel -> AppleScript fallback`) via `MacosNativeFolderPickerBridge.swift`; `PlatformNativeFolderPicker` no longer calls Objective-C++ fallback, and `mfx_entry_runtime_common` no longer links legacy folder-picker `.mm` sources.
- macOS automation app-catalog scan path is now Swift-owned (`MacosApplicationCatalogBridge.swift` + callback bridge), and legacy Objective-C++ scan workflow files are removed from main `mfx_shell_macos` build wiring.
- macOS foreground-process resolver is now Swift-owned (`MacosForegroundProcessBridge.swift` + `MacosForegroundProcessService.cpp`), and legacy `MacosForegroundProcessService*.mm` is removed from main `mfx_shell_macos` build wiring.
- macOS input-permission resolver is now Swift-owned (`MacosInputPermissionBridge.swift` + `MacosInputPermissionState.cpp`), and legacy `MacosInputPermissionState*.mm` is removed from main `mfx_shell_macos` build wiring.
- macOS Objective-C++ dependent `.cpp` sources now compile with ObjC++ mode (`-x objective-c++`) in `Platform/macos/CMakeLists.txt` for `Platform/macos/legacy/*`, `Platform/macos/Overlay/*`, and `Platform/macos/Wasm/*`, so ongoing `.mm -> .cpp` migration and main-path promotions do not break Cocoa/AppKit symbols.
- macOS tray menu localization is now Swift-owned (`MacosTrayMenuLocalizationBridge.swift` + `MacosTrayMenuLocalization.cpp`), and mac build wiring no longer requires legacy `MacosTrayMenuLocalization.mm`.
- macOS legacy tree now has `0` `.mm` files under `Platform/macos/legacy` (all renamed to `.cpp`); build wiring was updated accordingly and continues to compile these sources in ObjC++ mode via CMake file-level flags.
- macOS tray menu creation/release/auto-trigger/terminate path is now Swift-owned (`MacosTrayMenuBridge.swift` + `MacosTrayMenuSwiftBridge.h` + `MacosTrayMenuFactory.cpp` thin C++ adapter); `MacosTrayService.cpp` is now pure C++ call-through and main build wiring no longer depends on legacy `MacosTrayMenuFactory.ActionBridge.cpp`, `MacosTrayMenuFactory.Items.cpp`, or `MacosTrayRuntimeHelpers.cpp`.
- Obsolete tray legacy files were removed from repository to keep single-source ownership clear: `legacy/Shell/MacosTrayMenuFactory.ActionBridge.cpp`, `legacy/Shell/MacosTrayMenuFactory.Items.cpp`, `legacy/Shell/MacosTrayRuntimeHelpers.cpp`, `legacy/Shell/MacosTrayMenuLocalization.cpp`, and unused headers `Shell/MacosTrayMenuFactory.Internal.h`, `Shell/MacosTrayRuntimeHelpers.h`.
- macOS event-loop AppKit bridge is now Swift-owned (`MacosEventLoopBridge.swift` + `MacosEventLoopSwiftBridge.h`), and C++ side calls through a thin wrapper (`Shell/MacosEventLoopBridge.cpp`).
- Stable Shell adapters are now promoted from `legacy/Shell` to `Shell` main path (`MacosTrayService.cpp`, `MacosTrayMenuFactory.cpp`, `MacosEventLoopBridge.cpp`, `MacosTraySmokeMain.cpp`); `legacy/Shell` no longer owns active build sources.
- Input pipeline adapters are now promoted from `legacy/System` to `System` main path (global input hook, keyboard injector, key resolver/tables, virtual-key mapper, input-event utils), with `Platform/macos/CMakeLists.txt` updated to consume main-path sources.
- Obsolete legacy System fallback implementations were removed after Swift bridge cutover (app-catalog scan workflow, foreground-process resolver, input-permission resolver, native-folder-picker fallback chain), and unused legacy-only headers in `Platform/macos/System` were deleted to keep single-source ownership.
- Overlay runtime implementation is now promoted from `legacy/Overlay` to `Overlay` main path (`MacosInputIndicatorOverlay*`, `MacosOverlayCoordSpace*`), with source wiring switched to main-path files.
- WASM overlay/runtime implementation is now promoted from `legacy/Wasm` to `Wasm` main path (`MacosWasmCommandRenderer*`, `MacosWasmOverlayState*`, `MacosWasmTextOverlay*`, `MacosWasmImageOverlayRenderer*`), with source wiring switched to main-path files.
- Effects runtime implementation is now promoted from `legacy/Effects` to `Effects` main path (`MacosClick/Trail/Scroll/Hover/Hold*`, `MacosOverlayRenderSupport*`, `MacosTextEffectFallback*`), with source wiring switched to main-path files.
- `/api/state.wasm` now exposes macOS overlay throttle-policy diagnostics (`overlay_max_inflight`, `overlay_min_image_interval_ms`, `overlay_min_text_interval_ms`), and core HTTP state contracts assert these fields on macOS.
- core automation regression now sets deterministic macOS overlay-policy test env defaults (`MFX_MACOS_WASM_OVERLAY_MAX_INFLIGHT=77`, `MFX_MACOS_WASM_IMAGE_MIN_INTERVAL_MS=9`, `MFX_MACOS_WASM_TEXT_MIN_INTERVAL_MS=11`) and asserts `/api/state.wasm` value-level parity via `MFX_EXPECT_MACOS_WASM_*`.
- `/api/state.wasm` and `/api/wasm/state` now expose lifetime WASM dispatch diagnostics (`lifetime_invoke_*`, `lifetime_render_dispatches`, `lifetime_executed_*`, `lifetime_throttled_*`, `lifetime_dropped_render_commands`) in addition to `last_*` snapshot fields.
- core WASM dispatch contract checks (regression + manual selfcheck) now enforce lifetime counter invariants (`invoke_success + invoke_failed == invoke_calls`, throttle subtotal consistency, and lifetime counters not below dispatch snapshot), and schema/state checks assert `lifetime_*` key exposure.
- WebUI semantic phase now includes `pnpm --dir MFCMouseEffect/WebUIWorkspace run test:wasm-state-model` to gate `normalizeWasmState` passthrough for lifetime WASM diagnostics.
- WebUI WASM diagnostics panel now renders both `last_*` and `lifetime_*` summaries (invoke/render), and WebUI semantic phase now includes `pnpm --dir MFCMouseEffect/WebUIWorkspace run test:wasm-diagnostics-model` to gate label coverage and formatting contracts.
- Validation passed:
  - `cmake -S MFCMouseEffect/Platform -B /tmp/mfx-platform-macos-legacy-mm-build -DMFX_PACKAGE_PLATFORM=macos -DMFX_ENABLE_POSIX_CORE_RUNTIME=ON -DMFX_ENABLE_ENTRY_RUNTIME_TARGETS=ON`

  - WebSettings WASM runtime state/action internals are now split into endpoint-level route modules (`WasmRuntimeToggleRoutes.*`, `WasmRuntimePolicyRoute.*`, `WasmReloadRoute.*`, `WasmLoadManifestRoute.*`), keeping state/action files as delegators
  - Automation matcher/executor flow is now isolated in `InputAutomationDispatch.*`, while `InputAutomationEngine` remains focused on input event orchestration and state; gesture direction quantization/serialization is further split into `GestureRecognizer.Direction.cpp` to keep recognizer session flow and direction algorithm boundaries separate
  - test-gated `/api/input-indicator/test-keyboard-labels` now verifies keyboard indicator label rendering contract (`A`, `Cmd+K9`, `K6`) in core automation regression
  - `/api/state` `input_capture` now exposes `effects_suspended`, and core automation contracts assert suspension/resume transitions during permission revoke/regrant
  - AppController input-capture runtime/state orchestration is now isolated in `AppController.InputCapture.cpp`, with both CMake and Visual Studio build wiring updated to keep POSIX/Windows lanes aligned
  - AppController lifecycle orchestration (`Start/Stop/CreateDispatchWindow/DestroyDispatchWindow`) is now isolated in `AppController.Lifecycle.cpp`, with both CMake and Visual Studio build wiring updated to keep POSIX/Windows lanes aligned

  - AppController dispatch-state runtime helpers (`OnGlobalKey`, shortcut session lifecycle, hover/hold timers/state) are now isolated in `AppController.DispatchState.cpp`, with both CMake and Visual Studio build wiring updated to keep POSIX/Windows lanes aligned
  - macOS effect routing now covers click/trail/scroll/hold/hover categories (GPU hold routes remain excluded), with pluggable creator registry + shared overlay render support (`main-thread dispatch`/`window setup`) and config-driven render profile mapping (`EffectConfig -> mac click/trail/scroll/hold/hover profile`) to reduce renderer duplication and magic constants drift; type normalization now includes Windows-origin/legacy alias parity for hold (`hold_fluxfield_*`, `hold_neon3d_gpu_v2`, `scifi3d`) and trail/scroll/hover (`stream/stardust/direction/suspension` etc.), trail alias normalization is now shared by style/profile/throttle resolution, and profile tempo/intensity mapping has been tuned (trail/hold/hover + click/scroll) to keep mac visual pacing and visibility closer to Windows defaults without touching GPU route behavior; non-GPU overlays now share frame clamp + per-screen contents-scale + animation curve + alpha policy + geometry metric scaling + size-normalized duration helper policies across click/trail/scroll/hold/hover to reduce edge/multi-screen/mixed-DPI/curve/size/tempo drift, and suite-level policy gate now supports explicit no-ObjC++ edit enforcement; test-gated `/api/effects/test-render-profiles` now exposes resolved profile contracts for regression; settings schema reports `capabilities.effects.trail/scroll/hold/hover=true` on macOS
  - hold route constants now include `hold_fluxfield_cpu` as shared catalog key (`HoldRouteCatalog`), and both metadata/tray matching paths consume catalog constants for FluxField CPU/GPU variants to prevent cross-platform type drift
  - click effect path now has explicit compute/render split: shared core module `ClickEffectCompute` emits `ClickEffectRenderCommand` (normalized type/size/duration/opacity/palette/label), and macOS click renderer consumes that command as execution input; legacy renderer API remains as compatibility wrapper
  - macOS effect mainline now applies the same compute->command pattern to all 5 categories (`click/trail/scroll/hover/hold`): renderer entry points consume shared commands, and `/api/effects/test-render-profiles` now exposes `command_samples` (including `trail_emission`) so settings->command changes are contract-observable
  - macOS `render-profile -> compute-profile` conversion is now centralized in `MacosEffectComputeProfileAdapter` (click/trail/scroll/hover/hold + trail-throttle), and duplicated local builders were removed from effect + overlay + effects-profile-builder paths to reduce multi-point drift
  - Windows `EffectFactory` now applies shared normalize entry by category (click/trail/scroll/hold/hover) before registry/fallback selection, so win/mac effect-type semantic input uses the same normalization source while keeping Windows renderer backends unchanged
  - effects test-profile `command_samples` now also includes cross-category `alias_matrix` contracts (input->normalized), and regression asserts representative alias mappings (`TEXT/stream/stardust/suspension/hold_neon3d_gpu_v2`) to prevent silent type-semantic drift
  - effects test-profile `command_samples` now includes `effective_timing` baseline (click/trail/scroll/hover/hold timing fields), and effects contract regression asserts those fields to support command-level behavior-alignment tracking before pixel-level tuning
  - macOS scroll effect runtime now applies Windows-style input shaper semantics (type-based emit interval + pending-delta merge + duration cap), and `command_samples.effective_timing` now includes `scroll_emit_interval_ms` / `scroll_max_duration_ms` for parity observability
  - shared scroll render command now carries continuous `strength_scalar` + `intensity` (Windows-style), and macOS scroll body geometry now consumes that intensity to smooth high-delta transitions while preserving type/direction semantics
  - shared trail render command now carries continuous `speed_px` + `intensity`, and macOS trail layer styling (stroke/opacity) consumes that intensity to smooth fast-vs-slow movement response while preserving type semantics
  - shared scroll strength quantization now uses non-zero `1..6` levels (`abs(delta)/120` clamp), replacing coarse `0..3` thresholds for closer Windows parity in strength-driven sizing/timing
  - click shared normalization now canonicalizes `icon/icon_star -> star` and `textclick/text_click -> text`; hold route canonicalization now also normalizes `scifi3d -> hologram` and `neon3d -> hold_neon3d` (with lowercase-first alias resolution), and alias-matrix contracts assert these mappings
  - hold follow-mode normalization is now unified via `config_internal::TryNormalizeHoldFollowMode/NormalizeHoldFollowMode` across core apply path, hold compute parser, and scaffold state patch; aliases (`cursor_priority`, `performance_first`, `cpu_saver`, etc.) now canonicalize to (`smooth`/`efficient`) consistently, and effects alias-matrix contracts now expose/assert follow-mode alias mappings
  - effect-type normalization is now unified as single-source in runtime/config/profile paths: `AppController::ResolveRuntimeEffectType` now canonicalizes all five categories (not hold-only), `EffectFactory` now consumes normalized types on both macOS and Windows, and trail alias normalization (`scifi/sci-fi/sci_fi -> tubes`) is shared by `TrailEffectCompute`, `EffectConfig::GetTrailHistoryProfile`, and macOS trail profile/throttle resolution; effects command samples now expose `sample_input.active_raw` + `active_normalized` for active/effective alignment checks
  - macOS effect runtime now canonicalizes effect type once at effect-constructor boundary for all five categories (click/trail/scroll/hover/hold), and registry hold creator no longer does separate pre-normalization; runtime execution now consistently uses canonical ids before render command execution
  - effects contract checks now assert additional alias normalization samples (`click none`, `trail default/scifi`, `scroll none`, `hover none`) and sample-input normalized visibility (`active_raw`/`active_normalized`), and a one-command macOS manual selfcheck is available for five-category type parity (`run-macos-effects-type-parity-selfcheck.sh`)
  - hold-follow normalization contract is now header-inline (`EffectConfigInternal.h`) with local ASCII trim/lower processing, so scaffold/core lanes share one normalization source without introducing linker dependencies in scaffold builds
  - repo-root macOS shortcut launcher `./mfx` is now available for daily loops (`start`/`fast`/`effects`), reducing long manual command-path copy/paste during local testing
  - macOS tray exit path now actively removes status item and calls `NSApp terminate` in `MacosTrayService::RequestExit`, preventing stale menu-bar icon/process residue when clicking tray `Exit`
  - macOS trail `line` rendering now draws from previous emission point to current point (instead of fixed short dash segments), and trail overlay frame expands by `deltaX/deltaY` to avoid clipping at high cursor speed; this closes visible discontinuity where line trail looked like detached short bars
  - macOS `click=text` now routes to shared `TextEffect` (same semantic path as Windows) and uses platform fallback `MacosTextEffectFallback` for transparent floating text animation; this removes pulse-ring `LEFT/RIGHT/MIDDLE` text rendering from text-click mode
  - macOS trail `line` segmented emission path has been removed (back to single-command continuous emission), and `line` path shaping now uses real delta length + tighter throttle (`5ms/1.5px`) to reduce detached "matchstick" segments
- macOS trail `line` path shaping now uses real delta length (no short fixed `14..28px` clamp), and line throttle is tightened to `5ms/1.5px` to reduce dotted/matchstick artifacts
- macOS trail `line` now interpolates multi-segment emissions on large cursor deltas (line-only), so long sparse moves no longer render as isolated "matchsticks"; macOS text-click fallback now renders via `CATextLayer` (no `NSTextField` background), with per-frame font/color updates for Windows-like floating text
- macOS trail `line` now uses a persistent screen-sized path overlay (`MacosLineTrailOverlay`) to accumulate recent points and render a continuous stroke with idle fade, replacing per-pulse windows for `line` only to match Windows behavior under fast movement
- macOS line trail and text-click fallback now convert Quartz input points to Cocoa coords inside the overlay/fallback (avoids overlay-origin drift), and line overlay keeps the window alive briefly when only one point is present to prevent disappearing trails on slow movement
- macOS text-click fallback now exposes `/api/state.effects_runtime.text_effect` diagnostics (click/fallback/panel/error/last text) and prebuilds `NSString` before async dispatch to guard against lifetime-related no-show cases
- macOS text-click fallback now sets `CATextLayer` font via font-name string (valid `CFTypeRef`) to avoid invisible text when a non-bridged font object is rejected by Core Animation
- macOS line trail now clears historical points when the screen-sized overlay window is recreated (avoids stray long lines), uses config-driven line width for thickness, and non-line trail pulses now interpolate large deltas into multiple emissions to reduce matchstick gaps
- Trail 调参页新增 `line_width` 调节（通过 WebUI 直接设置并持久化），无需手改 config.json
- trail 类型 `none` 现在不会再被归一化为 `line`（真正关闭拖尾），并提升非 line 拖尾在快速移动时的分段密度以进一步降低“火柴棍”间隙
- apply_settings 现在会按元数据解析 effect 选项输入（value/alias/中英文 label + Trim），避免“无/None”被误判为未知并回落到 `line`
- macOS `line` 拖尾坐标链路已统一到 `ScreenToOverlayPoint`，并在单点采样时绘制最小可见点；`streamer` 分段长度/插值密度已调优，降低“火柴棍”断续感
- macOS `line` 拖尾分支已增加稀疏 move 事件插值补点（按轨迹分段写入 line overlay），避免输入合并时仅出现零散点/几乎无拖尾
- WebUI “Effects Runtime Profile” 区块改为默认隐藏；仅当 URL 包含 `effects_profile_debug=1`（或 `debug=1`）时显示，避免污染常规设置界面
- macOS move 路由在收到 (0,0) 事件坐标时改用光标查询结果兜底，避免偶发“左上角到鼠标”的直线；macOS trail 在 `none` 时直接返回防止误渲染
  - click routing now forces built-in path when active click type normalizes to `text` (skip wasm click render interception for that type), preventing `click=text` from becoming no-op when WASM route is enabled
  - macOS overlay frame clamp policy now preserves real input anchor (no origin retreat to keep full frame in screen); near-edge effects may clip partially but no longer drift inward
  - `TextEffect` click text path now has macOS-first fallback execution (`MacosTextEffectFallback`) plus empty-text-pool default-label guard (`LEFT/RIGHT/MIDDLE`), and text settings hot-reapply now uses normalized click type check (`NormalizeClickEffectType(config_.active.click) == text`)
  - macOS click overlay color path is now also config-driven (`EffectConfig.ripple.left/right/middle`) via `ClickRenderProfile`, replacing hardcoded per-button click colors to keep user-customized color behavior aligned with Windows
  - macOS scroll/hover overlay color paths are now profile-driven from runtime config/theme resolution (`ScrollRenderProfile` direction colors + `HoverRenderProfile` glow/tubes colors), replacing hardcoded constants while preserving direction/type visual differences
  - macOS trail/hold overlay color paths are now profile-driven from runtime config resolution (`TrailRenderProfile` type colors + `HoldRenderProfile` base/style colors), replacing hardcoded constants while preserving existing effect type/style semantics
  - effects profile contracts now include color fields in both test route (`/api/effects/test-render-profiles`) and state diagnostics (`/api/state.effects_profile`), and core automation contracts assert representative color keys to guard parity drift
  - macOS trail/scroll/hover render plans now include type-aware tempo/size scaling, so runtime motion pacing differs by effect type instead of relying on mostly uniform defaults
  - trail/scroll/hover tempo scales are now surfaced in both test-route and state diagnostics contracts, and core automation regression asserts representative tempo fields to guard against silent parity drift
  - effects profile contract checks now assert cross-API value parity (`/api/effects/test-render-profiles` vs `/api/state.effects_profile`) for representative tempo/color fields
  - `/api/state` now exposes non-test diagnostics `effects_profile` (`active` + `config_basis` + resolved click/trail/scroll/hold/hover profile fields), effects settings UI now renders that snapshot in a read-only diagnostics card with one-click JSON copy, and core state regression asserts those fields to guard profile-mapping drift
  - `SettingsStateMapper` effects diagnostics are now isolated in `SettingsStateMapper.EffectsDiagnostics.cpp` (runtime overlay counters + profile snapshot), keeping `SettingsStateMapper.Diagnostics.cpp` focused on GPU/WASM/input-capture diagnostics while preserving `/api/state.effects_runtime` and `/api/state.effects_profile` contracts
  - test-only effects routes are now split by capability (`WebSettingsServer.TestEffectsProfileApiRoute.*` + `WebSettingsServer.TestEffectsOverlayApiRoute.*`) with `WebSettingsServer.TestEffectsApiRoutes.cpp` as delegator, reducing route-level coupling while preserving `/api/effects/test-render-profiles` and `/api/effects/test-overlay-windows` contracts
  - macOS hold overlay renderer now delegates hold-style normalization/color/path-accent construction to `MacosHoldPulseOverlayStyle.*`, keeping `MacosHoldPulseOverlayRenderer.mm` lifecycle/state-focused without changing public hold overlay API contracts
  - macOS trail overlay renderer now delegates trail-style normalization/color/path construction to `MacosTrailPulseOverlayStyle.*`, keeping `MacosTrailPulseOverlayRenderer.mm` lifecycle/animation-focused without changing public trail overlay API contracts

  - macOS click/scroll renderers are now split into thin wrappers plus dedicated core units (`MacosClickPulseOverlayRendererCore.*`, `MacosScrollPulseOverlayRendererCore.*`), reducing renderer-file coupling while preserving behavior and API contracts
  - macOS hold/trail renderers are now split into thin wrappers plus dedicated core units (`MacosHoldPulseOverlayRendererCore.*`, `MacosTrailPulseOverlayRendererCore.*`), and hold core start flow is further isolated in `MacosHoldPulseOverlayRendererCore.Start.mm`, reducing renderer-file coupling while preserving behavior and API contracts
  - macOS effect probe route now accepts per-category type arguments (`click/trail/scroll/hold/hover`), and core automation contracts exercise non-default type matrix (`text/electric/helix/hold_quantum_halo_gpu_v2/tubes`)

  - wasm-focused suite shortcut entry is now available: `tools/platform/regression/run-posix-wasm-regression-suite.sh` (pins `--core-automation-check-scope wasm` and skips non-wasm mac selfchecks)
  - scope-pinned shortcut entries now reject conflicting scope arguments (`run-posix-core-effects-contract-regression.sh`, `run-posix-effects-regression-suite.sh`, `run-posix-wasm-regression-suite.sh`) for both `--arg value` and `--arg=value` forms, preventing accidental scope override drift
  - conflicting-scope rejection in shortcut entries is now implemented via shared helper (`mfx_reject_option_in_args`), reducing duplicate shell logic and keeping failure semantics consistent
  - manual macOS core-host selfcheck teardown now uses bounded staged stop (`TERM` with timeout, then `KILL` fallback via `MFX_MANUAL_STOP_TIMEOUT_SECONDS`) to reduce leftover host-process interference between repeated selfchecks
  - macOS manual selfcheck scripts now acquire `mfx-entry-posix-host` lock before optional build phase (not only before host startup), reducing build/start races under concurrent manual/suite execution
  - macOS manual selfcheck scripts now reuse a single host-binary prepare helper (`mfx_manual_prepare_core_host_binary`), unifying core-build flags and executable validation across automation/effects/wasm/websettings checks
  - macOS manual selfcheck scripts now also share common numeric option validation helpers (`mfx_manual_apply_build_jobs_env`, `mfx_manual_validate_non_negative_integer`) for consistent `--jobs` / `--auto-stop-seconds` contracts
  - `cmake` dependency checks for macOS manual selfchecks are now centralized in host-binary prepare helper and only enforced when build is requested (`--skip-build=0`), avoiding unnecessary dependency gating in skip-build flows

  - effects test-profile route now also reuses `effects_profile.active` payload (including `hold`/`hover`), and effects contract checks assert active hold/hover visibility to guard route/state shape parity
  - effects contract parity now includes value-level active matching (`click/trail/scroll/hold/hover`) between `/api/effects/test-render-profiles` and `state.effects_profile`, not only section existence checks

  - WebUI effects profile model test coverage now includes `config_basis.test_tuning.opacity_scale/opacity_overridden` and section `base_opacity` (`click/trail/scroll/hold/hover`) passthrough checks
  - core HTTP regression startup now tolerates missing core probe file by recovering `url/token` from launch-probe URL when available, reducing false negatives caused by probe write timing gaps
  - effects contract shortcut entry (`run-posix-core-effects-contract-regression.sh`) now defaults to non-default test tuning values (`duration=0.5`, `size=1.2`, `opacity=0.78`, `trail_throttle=0.6`) and auto-aligns `MFX_EXPECT_EFFECTS_*`, so each effects run validates override paths by default
  - core HTTP startup requirement is now scope-aware: launch-probe is required only for `all` scope (input-launch contracts), while `effects/wasm` scopes no longer fail on missing launch-probe artifacts
  - POSIX core regression probe emission now treats launch-open failure as non-fatal for core probe output (launch result remains observable in launch-probe), and effects/wasm scope startup no longer injects launch-probe env variables
  - core HTTP startup now captures probe diagnostics file (`MFX_CORE_WEB_SETTINGS_PROBE_DIAGNOSTICS_FILE`) and prints `status/reason` on startup failure, improving root-cause visibility for probe emission failures
  - WebSettings startup diagnostics now include HTTP server start stage/code (`websettings_start_failed(stage=<n>,code=<err>)`) from `HttpServer`, so probe-start failures can be triaged by socket/bind/listen/thread stage
  - core HTTP startup failure logging now adds explicit hint for `websettings_start_failed(stage=2,code=1)` (bind `EACCES`) to distinguish environment/sandbox permission blocks from product regressions
  - effects contract shortcut entry now has dedicated `--help` output with its injected default test tuning values and forwarded options, reducing wrapper-vs-core usage ambiguity
  - effects contract shortcut now defaults `MFX_CORE_HTTP_ALLOW_BIND_EACCES_SKIP=1`; when startup diagnostics detect `websettings_start_failed(stage=2,code=1)`, effects scope exits as explicit `skipped` instead of hard failure (to avoid environment-sandbox false negatives)
  - wasm contract shortcut now also defaults `MFX_CORE_HTTP_ALLOW_BIND_EACCES_SKIP=1`, aligning constrained-runtime skip behavior with effects contract shortcut
  - macOS effects-profile JSON assembly is split into dedicated builder module (`SettingsStateMapper.EffectsProfileStateBuilder.Macos.cpp`), while `SettingsStateMapper.EffectsProfileStateBuilder.cpp` keeps platform-neutral envelope logic only
  - regression startup/stop numeric env tuning is now tolerant to invalid inputs (falls back to defaults in `http_entry_helpers`/`core_http_entry_helpers`), reducing accidental shell-env misconfiguration failures during local loops
  - core automation scope values are now normalized by shared helper (`mfx_normalize_core_automation_check_scope`) across suite/core-http/core-automation entry points, keeping scope contract parsing consistent (supports mixed-case inputs like `EFFECTS`)
  - regression `mfx_fail` output now writes to stderr, so invalid-option diagnostics remain visible even when failures occur inside command-substitution call paths
  - core HTTP regression stop/HTTP helpers are now timeout-hardened (`MFX_CORE_HTTP_STOP_TIMEOUT_SECONDS`, `MFX_HTTP_CONNECT_TIMEOUT_SECONDS`, `MFX_HTTP_MAX_TIME_SECONDS`) to avoid indefinite hangs in wasm/effects/all scopes
  - core HTTP regression stop path now uses staged shutdown (`stdin-exit -> TERM -> KILL`) with dedicated waits (`MFX_CORE_HTTP_GRACEFUL_STOP_WAIT_SECONDS`, `MFX_CORE_HTTP_TERM_WAIT_SECONDS`) to reduce unnecessary tail-latency in repeated wasm/effects loops
  - scaffold HTTP entry startup now includes bounded early-exit retry (`MFX_HTTP_ENTRY_START_RETRIES`, default `1`) with per-attempt fifo cleanup to reduce transient false-negative regressions
  - scaffold regression (`run-posix-scaffold-regression.sh`) now runs smoke/HTTP checks under shared entry-host lock (`mfx-entry-posix-host`) to prevent concurrent suite runs from causing startup false negatives
  - posix full suite (`run-posix-regression-suite.sh`) now runs under suite-level lock (`mfx-posix-regression-suite`, timeout via `MFX_POSIX_SUITE_LOCK_TIMEOUT_SECONDS`) so concurrent invocations serialize instead of cross-interfering
  - shared WebUI effects profile model now preserves backend `config_basis` diagnostics (including `test_tuning`) instead of dropping it during normalization

## Current Next Slice
- Continue M2 with macOS-first WASM quality and contract hardening.
- Keep platform abstraction reusable for Linux follow-up.
- Keep Windows behavior unchanged unless explicit approved scope.

## Behavior Contracts to Preserve
1. Permission loss on macOS should degrade safely, keep process alive, and notify clearly.
2. Permission restore should recover without requiring process restart.
3. Scaffold lane contracts must remain unchanged.
4. Core lane API contracts must stay backward-compatible.
5. Web settings must remain Svelte-based and shared across platforms.
6. WASM plugin catalog/import/export API semantics should stay aligned across Windows and POSIX core lane.
