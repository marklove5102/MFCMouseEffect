  - core HTTP regression WASM load helpers are now split into `tools/platform/regression/lib/core_http_wasm_helpers.sh`, reducing coupling in `core_http.sh`
  - core HTTP regression now supports scoped checks (`all` default, `wasm` focused) so WASM closure can run a dedicated gate without full automation/input contracts

  - POSIX regression entry scripts now share helperized host-platform detection and `--platform` resolution to keep cross-host guard semantics centralized
  - core regression entry scripts now share helperized workflow preparation and lock execution (`mfx_prepare_core_entry_runtime`, `mfx_run_with_entry_lock`)

```

## macOS Manual Runner
Use this one-command entry for manual WebSettings verification on macOS core lane:
```bash
./tools/platform/manual/run-macos-core-websettings-manual.sh --auto-stop-seconds 60
```

Use this one-command entry for WASM runtime invoke/render/fallback selfcheck:
```bash
./tools/platform/manual/run-macos-wasm-runtime-selfcheck.sh --skip-build
```

Use this one-command entry for automation injection selfcheck (`left_click -> Cmd+C` path):
```bash
./tools/platform/manual/run-macos-automation-injection-selfcheck.sh --skip-build
```

## Current Next Slice
- Continue M2 with macOS-first WASM quality and contract hardening.
- Keep platform abstraction reusable for Linux follow-up.
- Keep Windows behavior unchanged unless explicit approved scope.

## Behavior Contracts to Preserve
1. Permission loss on macOS should degrade safely, keep process alive, and notify clearly.
2. Permission restore should recover without requiring process restart.
3. Scaffold lane contracts must remain unchanged.
4. Core lane API contracts must stay backward-compatible.
5. Web settings must remain Svelte-based and shared across platforms.
6. WASM plugin catalog/import/export API semantics should stay aligned across Windows and POSIX core lane.
